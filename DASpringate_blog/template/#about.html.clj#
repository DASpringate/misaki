I am a biostatistician and informatician in the [Primary Care Research Group](http://www.medicine.manchester.ac.uk/primarycare/) at the University of Manchester.  In 2011 I completed a PhD in evolutionary biology.

I have been programming seriously for over four years and am proficient in R and Python and am becoming so with Clojure, which I use largely for web development, though it is rapidly becoming my favourite language of all. I also have some experience with Common Lisp, Scheme, Haskell, Processing, bash scripting, SQL and Stata programming.")]]
